Clone of tellonym.me created in react.

## Why? (back story) ðŸ“–

Me and my friend created spotted fan papge of our school, firstly we used only messages throught facebook, but over time we decided to give users anonimity in asking. We right away seen results in increased activity on site. After few weeks of managing everything thorught tellonym.me we were really overwhelmed with a lot of quesetions and managing them as we didnt know hich ones we already posted. 

This clone is creating for us really friendly environment without any addons which we dont want. Simply we can tag questions which are already posted and delete them.

### For now app isnt finished but it's in the state of MVP.

## How to use it on my own? ðŸ¤”

Firstly you need to refill ````.env```` file with keys to database and then feel free to build it ;) and you're ready to go!! 
Of course change the title of app, because you dont want to propably use "Spotted Staszic" ðŸ˜œ
